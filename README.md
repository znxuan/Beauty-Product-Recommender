# Beauty-Product-Recommender

## Overview
The Beauty-Product-Recommender is a natural language processing (NLP) project that leverages Large Language Models (LLM), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RaG), and LangChain to provide personalized beauty product recommendations. This project uses advanced NLP techniques and semantic chunking to process product reviews and user queries.

The system performs semantic search and review summarization using product data and customer reviews stored in Chroma DB. The application extracts useful insights and tailors its recommendations based on user queries, providing personalized beauty advice.

The process includes analyzing product reviews, identifying pros and cons, sentiment analysis, and summarizing key recommendations.
